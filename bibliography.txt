    bibliography of sources concerning instructional patterns for research libraries. Written for an
    academic audience, the author provides information on how such a bibliography can be used.

    book proves a good source for examples.

Harmon, Robert. “Elements of Bibliography.” American Scholar 65 (1989): 24-36. Although this
    article from a scholarly journal does not focus on annotated bibliographies, the author does a
    superior job of indicating the reason and process of general bibliography. Harmon writes this
    text for librarians who must focus on detailing books. The bibliography for this text is
    annotated and provides a good source of examples.

Mitchell, Jason. “PMLA Letter.” 1991. 23 May 1996.
    <http:10/28/2008/sunset.backbone.olemiss.edu/-jmitchel/plma.htm>. Mitchell protests the
    “pretentious gibberish” of modern literary critics in his letter to PMLA. He argues that
    “Eurojive” is often produced by English professors to show that their status is equal to that of
    math and science faculty. His sense of humor makes this letter a great read.

Beebe, Maurice. Ivory Towers and Sacred Founts: The Artist as Hero in Fiction from Goethe to Joyce.
    New York: New York University Press, 1964. This is a fascinating study of the writer's dual
    identity as artist and as individual. The source seems good for ideas about objectifying
    intensely personal experiences.

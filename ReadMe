This script is a Text File Concatenator. It will concatenate multiple text
files into one output file. 

This is a useful script because it is very versatile and straight forward.
A use case for this would be adding the bibliography onto the end of an essay.
Since I don't like cluttering my workspace I create a separate file for my
annotated bibliography. I could run this script when finished to combine the two.

This script is a Text File Concatenator. It will concatenate multiple text
files into one output file. 

This is a useful script because it is very versatile and straight forward.
A use case for this would be adding the bibliography onto the end of an essay.
Since I don't like cluttering my workspace I create a separate file for my
annotated bibliography. I could run this script when finished to combine the two.

The regular expression option (-r) can be used to filter any content of any of the concatenated text files. Inlcluded in the repository are the example files I used. I used the regular expression "[0-9]{4}" to filter all of the dates in the bibliography.
